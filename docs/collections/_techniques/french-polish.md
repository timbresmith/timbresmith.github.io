## The French Polish

When a high gloss finish is desired for a project, a french polish can be applied to achieve this look. A french polish is the process of applying many layers of shellac such that the resulting finish is high gloss. Shellac is a resin that is dissolved in alcohol and can be applied to woodworking projects. As each layer of shellac dissolves into the next, it is forgiving to apply and repair. Shellac dries quickly and at lower temperatures than other finishes which makes it very convenient as well. It also is non toxic. So comparing this to other finishes, less care is needed during application to limit exposure.

A french polish is not without its cons however. Compared to other finishes, its durability is low. Water, alcohol, and heat can all damage the surface, so this is not an appropriate finish for projects that will be subject to these elements. The prep work and multiple application sessions required makes this a time consuming finish as well.

Regardless of any pros or cons to this technique, it can't be denied that this is a very beautiful finish. As the final coats are being applied, the reward for the effort becomes very apparent.

### Tools needed for application
* Shellac
* Alcohol
* Application pads
* If pore filling with shellac, pumice powder (2f or 4f)

Shellac can come pre dissolved in cans or undissolved in flake form. Because shellac has a short shelf life after it has been dissolved, waiting to do this until you are ready for finishing will help your shellac last longer with less waste.

If using flakes, the shellac will need to be dissolved in alcohol into a jar with a lid. The ratio of shellac flakes to alcohol is measured in pound cuts. A 1 pound cut is one pound of shellac to one gallon of alcohol. The larger the cut, the more shellac is being put down during application, but it is also slower to dry.

Dissolving shellac into alcohol can take several hours, so it is recommended to mix up the solution the day before you start to apply the finish. Periodically give the solution a shake to help prevent the shellac from forming a lump at the bottom of the jar and slowing down the process. Some even go as far as using a magnetic stirrer to continually mix the solution together. To further speed things up, the flakes can be ground into a powder before mixing with alcohol. A coffee grinder works well for this.

#### Alcohol
Denatured alcohol is a common solvent for shellac. Denatured alcohol has additives added to it to discourage drinking and will make it toxic or taste bad. If you wish to minimize chemicals like this in your shop, everclear is an alternative to denatured alcohol that works just as well, albeit a more expensive one.                                                

#### Application Pads

To apply shellac, you can create a pad out of an old t-shirt. Cut a square piece roughly 6 inches long and then fill it with around 5 cotton balls or a cut up old sock. Fold the ends up and tie it off with tape or a rubber band. Shellac can be squirted onto the surface to fill the pad. When it is rubbed on your piece, it will deposit the stored shellac.

#### Pumice Powder
To pore fill the surface of wood, pumice powder can be used as an abrasive. Similarly made to the shellac application pad, fill an old t shirt with 2F or 4F pumice and tie the ends off. When the pad is tapped against a surface, a tiny amount of powder will be left behind. Rub this powder onto a shellac covered surface with an alcohol filled application pad to create a slurry to be filled into pores.

### Process

The steps that I take to apply a french polish are as follows:
1. Prepare the surface by sanding to a high grit.
2. Fill open pores.
3. Add a few base coats of shellac at a 2lb cut.
4. Polish with coats of shellac at a 1lb cut.
5. Spirit off oil that has been used.

#### Surface preparation                     
The project's surface should be sanded to 220 grit. This should remove any big scratches and give the surface an even feel. The application of alcohol can leave the surface feeling rough even if the surface felt smooth beforehand. This roughness is called raised grain. Raised grain typically only happens one time, so if we intentionally raise the grain and then sand after, we should be left with a surface that remains smooth even when alcohol is applied. So after the first session of sanding, wipe the project's surface with a rag dampened with water. Once dry, sand with 220 again, before moving on the next step.

#### Fill wood pores
Some wood have pores that will need to be filled. If this doesn't happen, the shellac will be pulled into the pores enough to cause a dimply finish. While there is nothing wrong with a dimply finish if that is desired, to achieve a nice french polish we want to prevent those dimples as much as possible.

There are different products that can be used for the pore filling step. Using wood filler or epoxy are two mediums that can be used for this purpose. The more traditional approach would be to just fill the pores with shellac. A few layers of shellac are applied to the surface. After drying, the surface is dabbed with a pumice filled application pad. Then another application pad, wet with only alcohol, is rubbed over the pumice and the surface. The pumice abrades the surface, creating a slurry of wood and shellac that is pushed into pores. As the pad dries out more alcohol is added. If more slurry is needed, another dab of the pumice may be applied. This process isn't quick and may take more than two layers of shellac applied to fill all the pores. At least two layers should be used as the first coat of shellac will most likely shrink into the wood pores as it dries.A second coat should help with this after at least a day of dry time between coats.

Once the pores look to be filled, the surface should be carefully sanded back to give an even starting point for the actual polishing step. The sanding should only be enough to remove the excess shellac next to the pores without pulling out the shellac in the pores.

#### Base coats
Add a few of coats of shellac at a 2lb cut waiting at least 30 minutes between coats. This gives some thickness to the finish before moving on to the polishing step. Fill the application pad with shellac by pouring some onto its surface. The pad should be wet enough to leave shellac on the surface of the project during application, without being so wet as to be drippy. You can test this by tapping the pad on the palm of your hand. If shellac rushes out in a pool, you have too much. Just a wet spot on the palm should be sufficient. If the pad starts to stick or drag on the surface during application, it has gone too dry. Add more shellac if this happens.

#### Polish with coats of shellac at a 1lb cut.
After a few base coats of shellac have been applied, wait at least a day before starting the polishing step. Thin your shellac down to a 1lb cut and start applying the shellac to the surface. As this is a thinner solution, it should evaporate a bit faster than when applying the base coats. Oil can be used as a lubricant to keep the pad moving without sticking to the surface. A non drying oil, such as olive oil, is great for this.A tiny dab onto your finger tip that is then rubbed onto the pad's surface should be sufficient. If you use a tiny bit more oil, you might find some success with a method to help give indication that you have the right amount of alcohol in your pad. You look for what is called a vapor trail that is left behind your pad as you move it across the surface. This vapor trail is the alcohol evaporating through the oil. If your trail is short, like an inch or so you have a proper amount of shellac in your pad. If you have a really long trail, then you have too much shellac. If you have no trail, then your pad is too dry. Or you don't have enough oil for this technique to work.

After applying a few coats to the surface wait a day or so before you start another polishing session. Repeat this step until you are satisfied with the gloss on the surface. This might take 3 or 4 sessions until you are satisfied with the gloss.

#### Spirit off oil that has been used.
Between polishing sessions you might need to spirit off any oil used. We don't want the oil in our finish, so with an even thinner cut of shellac, maybe a 0.5lb cut, wipe off any oil left of the surface of your project.
